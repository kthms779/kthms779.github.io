          <h5>Deepfakes are images or videos created by computers or machine learning software which appear real. According to this article, “in politics, the technology is used to discredit candidates and influence voters through inaccurate political messages on social media platforms.” With the already abundance of fake news in the world and the coming 2020 US presidential elections, I shudder to think of what this technology could do to people’s understanding of various circumstances. The technology can be used for many other purposes too- cybercriminals can use it to generate compromising photos or videos of individuals and blackmail them. It’s remarkable to see how AI has developed to be able to achieve this.</h5>

          <h5>Following the exposure of 400 million people’s phone numbers from Facebook back in September of this year, we see another data breach they have faced. Here, 267 million people’s personal information have been leaked. I find it astounding how such a huge company with a product with countless users is not able to produce a good enough security system in their servers. I personally don’t use Facebook, but this is still an unacceptable matter in my view; people should not have to worry whether any of their personal information gets leaked.

          <h5>I find it difficult to comprehend how people can blatantly disregard others’ privacy, let alone the government. Furthermore, this being one of the only ways of communicating via WiFi with the outside world in the UAE is sad to hear. Luckily this app is free. However, its substitute known as ‘Botim’ is paid, and also records every conversation, movement, relationship, appointment, sound and image of those who install it. They are completely destroying the trust of the people, which is intolerable. People should be protesting against this and with this news reveal, I hope to see action taken.

          <h5>Hospitals have increasingly become the target of ransomware attacks over the past year - in which hackers disable a victims’ files or systems and will only release the decryption key once a ransom is paid. At a time where hospitals and healthcare groups are overwhelmed by the COVID-19 outbreak, they are much more vulnerable, and this has led them to be targeted more. In this case, the US department of health was attacked which could “tip the system over”. It is really sad to see that there are those who are trying to take advantage of the vulnerability caused by this pandemic, but luckily not much damage had occurred in this attack.

          <h5>There has always been a large controversy with how tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. store excessive amounts of user data and utilize that to manipulate users by customizing ads and posts to appeal to them, as well as worries of its vulnerability. Google has decided to bring about a policy change in order to fight against said controversy -  the maximum period of user location data that is stored in Google’s database is now 18 months before it gets automatically deleted. Google has also made it easier for mobile users to switch to incognito mode on their browser, which was infamously difficult before. With these changes, I believe that Google is moving in the right direction to improve customer engagement and satisfaction by protecting the integrity of user data.

          <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54204356"><h4><b>Police launch homicide inquiry after German hospital hack (18/09/20):</b></h4></a>
          <h5>This tragic situation in Germany goes to show the harmful side of hacking when done for malicious purposes. The hackers attacked the hospital unintentionally rather than their target which led to the death of a woman whose life could have been saved- they could not transfer her to another hospital in time as it was too far away. Another point to note is that the hacker were able to access the hospital due to a flaw in the Virtual Private Network (VPN) that was developed for them by Citrix. Despite numerous warnings about the vulnerability, no action was taken and so it was exploited, leading to this tragedy. It goes to show the need to be watchful and be 100% secure, especially when the data is so sensitive.
