          <h5> A PR2 robot has been taught to repair itself by researchers from the University of Tokyo, though there are some limitations. This is a cool discovery in the world of robots! Robots being able to repair themselves may not seem like a big deal, but it makes the system much more efficient. As stated in the article, they become more independent and capable. We are now one step closer for robot world domination!

          <h5>“Cobots” stands for collaborative robots- robots who work in conjunction with humans. Unlike regular robots, they have been built to work together with humans, so they aid them in feats that are usually not able to be done by regular people. This includes providing super strength, precision, data capabilities, and more. These cobots can be used in the manufacturing industry, warehouses, etc.

          <h5>At Cornell University, Thomas Wallin and his colleagues have developed soft robotic grippers that are capable of sweating to cool down. They sweat much more than the average mammal (107 watts per kilogram in comparison to humans’ 35). At cold temperatures, the pores on the hydrogel fingers close. When the temperature exceeds 30 degrees Celsius, the surface layer expands thus opening the pores. The process is completely automatic thanks to the material used – no sensors are needed. This will help make untethered robots operate for longer without overheating, thus boosting efficiency and productivity, which is an interesting discovery.

          <h5>Engineers from Rutgers University have created a tabletop robot that can draw blood or insert catheters to deliver fluids and drugs. It uses AI with infrared and ultrasound sensors to detect where to inject the needle into a patient’s body. This could reduce the chance of injury which normally occurs due to human error. At the same time, due to more availability of nurses/doctors, they can focus on patients that need more attention which will be beneficial to society. Furthermore, after each injection, the AI becomes better and better at pinpointing the location of blood vessels, which shows the power of machine learning.

          <h5>Mira robotics, Japan, developed its avatar Ugo robot long ago to fight Japan’s shrinking workforce. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has found a new use for the robot in helping combat the virus in the workplace. Firstly, using the robot reduces direct contact between people. Secondly, its hand attachment uses ultraviolet light which kills viruses on door handles	, which will help reduce the spread of COVID-19. Finally, the robot is relatively cheap, can be rented for $1000 a month, and is easy to learn to use. Perhaps the usage of similar kinds of robots will slow down the transmission of the virus for those jobs that cannot be done from home.
