          <h5> Deepfakes are images or videos created by computers or machine learning software which appear real. According to this article, “in politics, the technology is used to discredit candidates and influence voters through inaccurate political messages on social media platforms.” With the already abundance of fake news in the world and the coming 2020 US presidential elections, I shudder to think of what this technology could do to people’s understanding of various circumstances. The technology can be used for many other purposes too- cybercriminals can use it to generate compromising photos or videos of individuals and blackmail them. It’s remarkable to see how AI has developed to be able to achieve this.

          <h5> With the combination of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and IoT (Internet of Things), I think humanity will evolve much more rapidly. Incorporating AI into everyday tasks such as in driving vehicles will increase the efficiency of the device, in my opinion. For instance, taking the vehicle example the article mentioned, we are able to easily collect data in vehicles from sensors, radars and the GPS, which can be uploaded onto the internet, allowing for the AI to monitor vehicle maintenance, driver behaviour, and more. AIoT has already been implemented in Tesla’s autopilot systems.

          <h5> This article talks about a recent study in Stanford University called the ‘AI Index’, in which they have tracked the growth of metrics and evaluated the use of AI in the world. The full details are in the article, however the findings on AI jobs particularly has really intrigued me. It states that “looking at Indeed postings between 2015 and October 2019, the share of AI jobs in the US increased five-fold since 2010”. The increased usage of AI in tech-related jobs is evidence of the continuous advancements that have been made, and I believe there will be widespread usage of AI in almost all sectors in the near future. I predict that 2020’s AI Index readings will show even more growth.

          <h5>The article discusses a drug molecule “invented” by AI to treat patients who have Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, going into human trials in Japan. It was developed rather quickly, in twelve months rather than the typical drug’s five years. This just goes to show the immense power of AI and machine learning to the point that it can facilitate difficult human tasks and improve efficiency. The article notes that the firm is using AI to look into potential drugs for the treatment of cancer and cardiovascular diseases, which could certainly help change the field of medicine. AI’s power never fails to amaze me and personally, I cannot wait for what the future holds for it.

          <h5>Engineers from Rutgers University have created a tabletop robot that can draw blood or insert catheters to deliver fluids and drugs. It uses AI with infrared and ultrasound sensors to detect where to inject the needle into a patient’s body. This could reduce the chance of injury which normally occurs due to human error. At the same time, due to more availability of nurses/doctors, they can focus on patients that need more attention which will be beneficial to society. Furthermore, after each injection, the AI becomes better and better at pinpointing the location of blood vessels, which shows the power of machine learning.

          <h5>Experts at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, have begun using artificial intelligence to create computer models that calculate the risk of a corona patient's needing intensive care or a ventilator. This will make it easier for doctors to predict which patients will need intensive care and a respirator. Due to excessive COVID-19 patients, there have been limited number of spaces in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and hospitals are often lacking in equipment such as respirators. This AI programme will help doctors allocate their equipment and time on patients who need it, improving the efficiency of medical centres.

          <h5>An AI-powered facial recognition software has been further developed to capture the identities of those violating the COVID-19 measures in Telangana, India. It leverages on computer vision and deep learning and has been implemented on surveillance CCTVs all across the state. This will help the police catch those who violate the mask mandate and makes it easier for them to punish them. This will incentivize citizens to wear the mask and can help in reducing the transmission of the virus. I feel like it is a great solution especially during a time where conspiracy theories and fake news are floating around and people falsely believe that masks do not work and are instead ‘harmful’.

          <h5>The article discusses OpenAI’s GPT-3 language model, an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. Seeing this article was a pleasant surprise and it demonstrates how far AI has become. The fact that the GPT-3 language was able to converse with the interviewer about a topic (the Big Bang) that many, including myself, don’t fully understand demonstrates the vast amount of information an AI programme can store and represent. In the future, an AI programme could store much more data than the human mind and that would be truly amazing.
